PMM project in JIRA . What are the minimum system requirements for PMM? \u00b6 See: PMM Server PMM Client How can I upgrade from PMM version 1? \u00b6 See Upgrade from PMM1 . How to control data retention for PMM? \u00b6 See How to configure Data retention . How often are NGINX logs in PMM Server rotated? \u00b6 PMM Server runs logrotate on a daily basis to rotate NGINX logs and keeps up to ten of the most recent log files. What privileges are required to monitor a MySQL instance? \u00b6 See Setting Up PMM Client . Can I monitor multiple service instances? \u00b6 You can add multiple instances of MySQL or some other service to be monitored from one PMM Client. In this case, you must provide a unique port and IP address, or a socket for each instance, and specify a unique name for each. (If a name is not provided, PMM uses the name of the PMM Client host.) For example, to add complete MySQL monitoring for two local MySQL servers, the commands would be: sudo pmm-admin add mysql --username root --password root instance-01 127 .0.0.1:3001 sudo pmm-admin add mysql --username root --password root instance-02 127 .0.0.1:3002 For more information, run: pmm-admin add mysql --help Can I rename instances? \u00b6 You can remove any monitoring instance and then add it back with a different name. When you remove a monitoring service, previously collected data remains available in Grafana. However, the metrics are tied to the instance name. So if you add the same instance back with a different name, it will be considered a new instance with a new set of metrics. So if you are re-adding an instance and want to keep its previous data, add it with the same name. Can I add an AWS RDS MySQL or Aurora MySQL instance from a non-default AWS partition? \u00b6 By default, the RDS discovery works with the default aws partition. But you can switch to special regions, like the GovCloud one, with the alternative AWS partitions (e.g. aws-us-gov ) adding them to the Settings via the PMM Server API . To specify other than the default value, or to use several, use the JSON Array syntax: [\"aws\", \"aws-cn\"] . How do I troubleshoot communication issues between PMM Client and PMM Server? \u00b6 See Troubleshoot PMM Server/PMM Client connection . What resolution is used for metrics? \u00b6 See Metrics resolution . How do I set up Alerting in PMM? \u00b6 When a monitored service metric reaches a defined threshold, PMM Server can trigger alerts for it either using the Grafana Alerting feature or by using an external alert manager. With these methods you must configure alerting rules that define conditions under which an alert should be triggered, and the channel used to send the alert (e.g. email). Alerting in Grafana allows attaching rules to your dashboard panels. Grafana Alerts are already integrated into PMM Server and may be simpler to get set up. Alertmanager allows the creation of more sophisticated alerting rules and can be easier to manage installations with a large number of hosts. This additional flexibility comes at the expense of simplicity. We only offer support for creating custom rules to our customers, so you should already have a working Alertmanager instance prior to using this feature. See also PMM Alerting with Grafana: Working with Templated Dashboards How do I use a custom Prometheus configuration file inside PMM Server? \u00b6 Normally, PMM Server fully manages the Prometheus configuration file . However, some users may want to change the generated configuration to add additional scrape jobs, configure remote storage, etc. From version 2.4.0, when pmm-managed starts the Prometheus file generation process, it tries to load the /srv/prometheus/prometheus.base.yml file first, to use it as a base for the prometheus.yml file. The prometheus.yml file can be regenerated by restarting the PMM Server container, or by using the SetSettings API call with an empty body. See also API Percona blog: Extending PMM\u2019s Prometheus Configuration How to troubleshoot an Update? \u00b6 See Troubleshoot update . What are my login credentials when I try to connect to a Prometheus Exporter? \u00b6 PMM protects an exporter\u2019s output from unauthorized access by adding an authorization layer. To access an exporter you can use \u201c pmm \u201d as a user name and the Agent ID as a password. You can find the Agent ID corresponding to a given exporter by running pmm-admin list . How to provision PMM Server with non-default admin password? \u00b6 Currently there is no API available to change the admin password. If you\u2019re deploying through Docker you can use the following code snippet to change the password after starting the Docker container: PMMPASSWORD = \"mypassword\" echo \"Waiting for PMM to initialize to set password...\" until [ \"`docker inspect -f {{.State.Health.Status}} pmm2-server`\" = \"healthy\" ] ; do sleep 1 ; done docker exec -t pmm2-server bash -c \"ln -s /srv/grafana /usr/share/grafana/data; grafana-cli --homepath /usr/share/grafana admin reset-admin-password $PMMPASSWORD \"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq.html#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq.html#how-can-i-contact-the-developers","text":"Community forum .

InnoDB Random Read Ahead \u00b6 The Threshold (in Pages) to trigger Linear Read Ahead. InnoDB Read IO Threads \u00b6 Number of Threads used to Schedule Reads. InnoDB Write IO Threads \u00b6 Number of Threads used to Schedule Writes. InnoDB Native AIO Enabled \u00b6 Whether Native Asynchronous IO is enabled. Strongly recommended for optimal performance. InnoDB Buffer Pool - Replacement Management \u00b6 LRU Scan Depth \u00b6 InnoDB LRU Scan Depth This variable defines InnoDB Free Page Target per buffer pool. When number of free pages falls below this number this number page cleaner will make required amount of pages free, flushing or evicting pages from the tail of LRU as needed. LRU Clean Page Searches \u00b6 When Page is being read (or created) the Page need to be allocated in Buffer Pool. Free List Miss Rate \u00b6 The most efficient way to get a clean page is to grab one from free list. However if no pages are available in Free List the LRU scan needs to be performed. LRU Get Free Loops \u00b6 If Free List was empty LRU Get Free Loop will be performed. It may perform LRU scan or may use some other heuristics and shortcuts to get free page. LRU Scans \u00b6 If Page could not be find any Free list and other shortcuts did not work, free page will be searched by scanning LRU chain which is not efficient. Pages Scanned in LRU Scans \u00b6 Pages Scanned Per Second while doing LRU scans. If this value is large (thousands) it means a lot of resources are wasted. Pages scanned per LRU Scan \u00b6 Number of pages scanned per LRU scan in Average. Large number of scans can consume a lot of resources and also introduce significant addition latency to queries. LRU Get Free Waits \u00b6 If InnoDB could not find a free page in LRU list and had to sleep. Should be zero. InnoDB Checkpointing and Flushing \u00b6 Pages Flushed from Flush List \u00b6 Number of Pages Flushed from \u201cFlush List\u201d This combines Pages Flushed through Adaptive Flush and Background Flush. Page Flush Batches Executed \u00b6 InnoDB Flush Cycle typically Runs on 1 second intervals. If too far off from this number it can indicate an issue. Pages Flushed Per Batch \u00b6 How many pages are flushed per Batch. Large Batches can \u201cchoke\u201d IO subsystem and starve other IO which needs to happen. Neighbor Flushing Enabled \u00b6 Neighbor Flushing is Optimized for Rotational Media and unless you\u2019re Running spinning disks you should disable it. InnoDB Checkpoint Age \u00b6 InnoDB Checkpoint Age The maximum checkpoint age is determined by the total length of all transaction log files ( innodb_log_file_size ). When the checkpoint age reaches the maximum checkpoint age, blocks are flushed synchronously. The rules of the thumb is to keep one hour of traffic in those logs and let the check-pointing perform its work as smooth as possible. If you don\u2019t do this, InnoDB will do synchronous flushing at the worst possible time, i.e., when you are busiest. Pages Flushed (Adaptive) \u00b6 Adaptive Flush Flushes pages from Flush List based on the need to advance Checkpoint (driven by Redo Generation Rate) and by maintaining number of dirty pages within set limit. Adaptive Flush Batches Executed \u00b6 Pages Per Batch (Adaptive) \u00b6 Pages Flushed Per Adaptive Batch. Neighbor Flushing \u00b6 To optimize IO for rotational Media InnoDB may flush neighbor pages. It can cause significant wasted IO for flash storage. Generally for flash you should run with innodb_flush_neighbors=0 but otherwise this shows how much IO you\u2019re wasting. Pages Flushed (LRU) \u00b6 Flushing from the tail of the LRU list is needed to keep readily-available free pages for new data to be read when data does not fit in the buffer pool. LRU Flush Batches Executed \u00b6 Pages Per Batch (LRU) \u00b6 Pages Flushed Per Neighbor. LSN Age Flush Batch Target \u00b6 Target for Pages to Flush due to LSN Age. Pages Flushed (Neighbor) \u00b6 Number of Neighbor pages flushed (If neighbor flushing is enabled) from Flush List and LRU List Combined. Neighbor Flush Batches Executed \u00b6 Pages Per Batch (Neighbor) \u00b6 Pages Flushed Per Neighbor. Sync Flush Waits \u00b6 If InnoDB could not keep up with Checkpoint Flushing and had to trigger Sync flush. This should never happen. Pages Flushed (Background) \u00b6 Pages Flushed by Background Flush which is activated when server is considered to be idle. Background Flush Batches Executed \u00b6 Pages Per Batch (Background) \u00b6 Pages Flushed Per Background Batch. Redo Generation Rate \u00b6 Rate at which LSN (Redo) is Created. It may not match how much data is written to log files due to block size rounding. InnoDB Flushing by Type \u00b6 Pages Evicted (LRU) \u00b6 This correspond to number of clean pages which were evicted (made free) from the tail of LRU buffer. Page Eviction Batches \u00b6 Pages Evicted per Batch \u00b6 Max Log Space Used \u00b6 Single Page Flushes \u00b6 Single Page flushes happen in rare case, then clean page could not be found in LRU list. It should be zero for most workloads. Single Page Flush Pages Scanned \u00b6 Pages Scanned Per Single Page Flush \u00b6 InnoDB IO Capacity \u00b6 Estimated number of IOPS storage system can provide. Is used to scale background activities. Do not set it to actual storage capacity. InnoDB IO Capacity Max \u00b6 InnoDB IO Capacity to use when falling behind and need to catch up with Flushing. InnoDB Logging \u00b6 Total Log Space \u00b6 Number of InnoDB Log Files Multiplied by Their Size. Log Buffer Size \u00b6 InnoDB Log Buffer Size The size of buffer InnoDB uses for buffering writes to log files. At Transaction Commit \u00b6 What to do with Log file At Transaction Commit. Do nothing and wait for timeout to flush the data from Log Buffer, Flush it to OS Cache but not FSYNC or Flush only. Flush Transaction Log Every \u00b6 Every Specified Number of Seconds Flush Transaction Log. InnoDB Write Ahead Block Size \u00b6 This variable can be seen as minimum IO alignment InnoDB will use for Redo log file. High Values cause waste, low values can make IO less efficient. Log Write Amplification \u00b6 How much Writes to Log Are Amplified compared to how much Redo is Generated. Log Fsync Rate \u00b6 Redo Generated per Trx \u00b6 Amount of Redo Generated Per Write Transaction. This is a good indicator of transaction size. InnoDB Log File Usage Hourly \u00b6 InnoDB Log File Usage Hourly Along with the buffer pool size, innodb_log_file_size is the most important setting when we are working with InnoDB. This graph shows how much data was written to InnoDB\u2019s redo logs over each hour. When the InnoDB log files are full, InnoDB needs to flush the modified pages from memory to disk. The rules of the thumb is to keep one hour of traffic in those logs and let the checkpointing perform its work as smooth as possible. If you don\u2019t do this, InnoDB will do synchronous flushing at the worst possible time, i.e., when you are busiest. This graph can help guide you in setting the correct innodb_log_file_size . Log Padding Written \u00b6 Amount of Log Padding Written. InnoDB Log File Size \u00b6 InnoDB Log Files \u00b6 Number of InnoDB Redo Log Files. Log Bandwidth \u00b6 Redo Generation Rate \u00b6 Rate at which LSN (Redo) is Created. It may not match how much data is written to log files due to block size rounding. InnoDB Group Commit Batch Size \u00b6 The InnoDB Group Commit Batch Size graph shows how many bytes were written to the InnoDB log files per attempt to write. If many threads are committing at the same time, one of them will write the log entries of all the waiting threads and flush the file. Such process reduces the number of disk operations needed and enlarge the batch size. InnoDB Locking \u00b6 Lock Wait Timeout \u00b6 InnoDB Lock Wait Timeout How long to wait for row lock before timing out. InnoDB Deadlock Detection \u00b6 If Disabled InnoDB Will not detect deadlocks but rely on timeouts. InnoDB Auto Increment Lock Mode \u00b6 Will Define How much locking will come from working with Auto Increment Columns. Rollback on Timeout \u00b6 Whenever to rollback all transaction on timeout or just last statement. Row Lock Blocking \u00b6 Percent of Active Sections which are blocked due to waiting on InnoDB Row Locks. Row Writes per Trx \u00b6 Rows Written Per Transactions which modify rows. This is better indicator of transaction write size than looking at all transactions which did not do any writes as well. Rollbacks \u00b6 Percent of Transaction Rollbacks (as portion of read-write transactions). InnoDB Row Lock Wait Activity \u00b6 InnoDB Row Lock Wait Time \u00b6 InnoDB Row Lock Wait Load \u00b6 Average Number of Sessions blocked from proceeding due to waiting on row level lock. InnoDB Row Locks Activity \u00b6 InnoDB Table Lock Activity \u00b6 Current Locks \u00b6 InnoDB Undo Space and Purging \u00b6 Undo Tablespaces \u00b6 Max Undo Log Size \u00b6 InnoDB Undo Log Truncate \u00b6 Purge Threads \u00b6 Max Purge Lag \u00b6 Maximum number of Unpurged Transactions, if this number exceeded delay will be introduced to incoming DDL statements. Max Purge Lag Delay \u00b6 Current Purge Delay \u00b6 The Delay Injected due to Purge Thread(s) unable to keep up with purge progress. Rollback Segments \u00b6 InnoDB Purge Activity \u00b6 The InnoDB Purge Performance graph shows metrics about the page purging process. The purge process removed the undo entries from the history list and cleanup the pages of the old versions of modified rows and effectively remove deleted rows. If you do not see any metric, try running: SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable=all; in the MySQL client. Transactions and Undo Records \u00b6 InnoDB Undo Space Usage \u00b6 The InnoDB Undo Space Usage graph shows the amount of space used by the Undo segment. If the amount of space grows too much, look for long running transactions holding read views opened in the InnoDB status. If you do not see any metric, try running: SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable=all; in the MySQL client. Transaction History \u00b6 InnoDB Purge Throttling \u00b6 Records Per Undo Log Page \u00b6 How Many Undo Operations Are Handled Per Each Undo Log Page. Purge Invoked \u00b6 How Frequently Purge Operation is Invoked. Ops Per Purge \u00b6 Home Many Purge Actions are done Per invocation. Undo Slots Used \u00b6 Number of Undo Slots Used. Max Transaction History Length \u00b6 Purge Batch Size \u00b6 Rseg Truncate Frequency \u00b6 InnoDB Page Operations \u00b6 InnoDB Page Splits and Merges \u00b6 The InnoDB Page Splits graph shows the InnoDB page maintenance activity related to splitting and merging pages. When an InnoDB page, other than the top most leaf page, has too much data to accept a row update or a row insert, it has to be split in two. Similarly, if an InnoDB page, after a row update or delete operation, ends up being less than half full, an attempt is made to merge the page with a neighbor page. If the resulting page size is larger than the InnoDB page size, the operation fails. If your workload causes a large number of page splits, try lowering the innodb_fill_factor variable (5.7+). If you do not see any metric, try running: SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable=all; in the MySQL client. Page Merge Success Ratio \u00b6 InnoDB Page Reorg Attempts \u00b6 The InnoDB Page Reorgs graph shows information about the page reorganization operations. When a page receives an update or an insert that affect the offset of other rows in the page, a reorganization is needed. If the reorganization process finds out there is not enough room in the page, the page will be split. Page reorganization can only fail for compressed pages. If you do not see any metric, try running: SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable=all; in the MySQL client. InnoDB Page Reorgs Failures \u00b6 The InnoDB Page Reorgs graph shows information about the page reorganization operations. When a page receives an update or an insert that affect the offset of other rows in the page, a reorganization is needed. If the reorganization process finds out there is not enough room in the page, the page will be split. Page reorganization can only fail for compressed pages. If you do not see any metric, try running: SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable=all; in the MySQL client. InnoDB Fill Factor \u00b6 The portion of the page to fill then doing sorted Index Build. Lowering this value will worsen space utilization but will reduce need to split pages when new data is inserted in the index.

Rows Added Per Page \u00b6 Number of Rows \u201cHashed\u201d Per Each Page which needs to be added to AHI. AHI ROI \u00b6 How Many Successful Searches using AHI are performed per each row maintenance operation. InnoDB AHI Usage \u00b6 The InnoDB AHI Usage graph shows the search operations on the InnoDB adaptive hash index and its efficiency. The adaptive hash index is a search hash designed to speed access to InnoDB pages in memory. If the Hit Ratio is small, the working data set is larger than the buffer pool, the AHI should likely be disabled. If you do not see any metric, try running: SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable=all; in the MySQL client. InnoDB AHI Miss Ratio \u00b6 InnoDB AHI Churn - Rows \u00b6 InnoDB AHI Churn - Pages \u00b6 InnoDB Change Buffer \u00b6 Change Buffer Max Size \u00b6 The Maximum Size of Change Buffer (as Percent of Buffer Pool Size). Change Buffer Max Size \u00b6 The Maximum Size of Change Buffer (Bytes). InnoDB Change Buffer Merge Load \u00b6 Number of Average of Active Merge Buffer Operations in Process. InnoDB Contention \u00b6 InnoDB Thread Concurrency \u00b6 If Enabled limits number of Threads allowed inside InnoDB Kernel at the same time. InnoDB Commit Concurrency \u00b6 If Enabled limits number of Threads allowed inside InnoDB Kernel at the same time during Commit Stage. InnoDB Thread Sleep Delay \u00b6 The Time the thread will Sleep before Re-Entering InnoDB Kernel if high contention. InnoDB Adaptive Max Sleep Delay \u00b6 If Set to Non-Zero Value InnoDB Thread Sleep Delay will be adjusted automatically depending on the load up to the value specified by this variable. InnoDB Concurrency Tickets \u00b6 Number of low level operations InnoDB can do after it entered InnoDB kernel before it is forced to exit and yield to another thread waiting. InnoDB Spin Wait Delay \u00b6 InnoDB Spin Wait Pause Multiplier \u00b6 InnoDB Sync Spin Loops \u00b6 InnoDB Contention - OS Waits \u00b6 The InnoDB Contention - OS Waits graph shows the number of time an OS wait operation was required while waiting to get the lock. This happens once the spin rounds are exhausted. If you do not see any metric, try running: SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable=all; in the MySQL client. InnoDB Contention - Spin Rounds \u00b6 The InnoDB Contention - Spin Rounds graph shows the number of spin rounds executed to get a lock. A spin round is a fast retry to get the lock in a loop. If you do not see any metric, try running: SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable=all; in the MySQL client. InnoDB Misc \u00b6 InnoDB Main Thread Utilization \u00b6 The InnoDB Main Thread Utilization graph shows the portion of time the InnoDB main thread spent at various task. If you do not see any metric, try running: SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable=all; in the MySQL client. InnoDB Activity \u00b6 The InnoDB Activity graph shows a measure of the activity of the InnoDB threads. If you do not see any metric, try running: SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable=all; in the MySQL client. InnoDB Dedicated Server \u00b6 InnoDB automatically optimized for Dedicated Server Environment (auto scaling cache and some other variables). InnoDB Sort Buffer Size \u00b6 This Buffer is used for Building InnoDB Indexes using Sort algorithm. InnoDB Stats Auto Recalc \u00b6 Update Stats when Metadata Queried \u00b6 Refresh InnoDB Statistics when meta-data queries by SHOW TABLE STATUS or INFORMATION_SCHEMA queries. If Enabled can cause severe performance issues. Index Condition Pushdown (ICP) \u00b6 Index Condition Pushdown (ICP) is an optimization for the case where MySQL retrieves rows from a table using an index. Without ICP, the storage engine traverses the index to locate rows in the base table and returns them to the MySQL server which evaluates the WHERE condition for the rows. With ICP enabled, and if parts of the WHERE condition can be evaluated by using only columns from the index, the MySQL server pushes this part of the WHERE condition down to the storage engine. The storage engine then evaluates the pushed index condition by using the index entry and only if this is satisfied is the row read from the table. ICP can reduce the number of times the storage engine must access the base table and the number of times the MySQL server must access the storage engine. InnoDB Persistent Statistics \u00b6 InnoDB Persistent Sample Pages \u00b6 Number of Pages To Sample if Persistent Statistics are Enabled. InnoDB Transient Sample Pages \u00b6 Number of Pages To Sample if Persistent Statistics are Disabled. InnoDB Online Operations (MariaDB) \u00b6 InnoDB Defragmentation \u00b6 The InnoDB Defragmentation graph shows the status information related to the InnoDB online defragmentation feature of MariaDB for the optimize table command. To enable this feature, the variable innodb-defragment must be set to 1 in the configuration file. Currently available only on a MariaDB server. InnoDB Online DDL \u00b6 The InnoDB Online DDL graph shows the state of the online DDL (alter table) operations in InnoDB. The progress metric is estimate of the percentage of the rows processed by the online DDL. Currently available only on a MariaDB server. MySQL Summary \u00b6 MySQL Uptime \u00b6 MySQL Uptime The amount of time since the last restart of the MySQL server process. Current QPS \u00b6 Current QPS Based on the queries reported by MySQL\u2019s SHOW STATUS command, it is the number of statements executed by the server within the last second. This variable includes statements executed within stored programs, unlike the Questions variable. It does not count COM_PING or COM_STATISTICS commands. File Handlers Used \u00b6 Table Open Cache Miss Ratio \u00b6 Table Open Cache Size \u00b6 Table Definition Cache Size \u00b6 MySQL Connections \u00b6 Max Connections Max Connections is the maximum permitted number of simultaneous client connections. By default, this is 151. Increasing this value increases the number of file descriptors that mysqld requires. If the required number of descriptors are not available, the server reduces the value of Max Connections. mysqld actually permits Max Connections + 1 clients to connect. The extra connection is reserved for use by accounts that have the SUPER privilege, such as root. Max Used Connections is the maximum number of connections that have been in use simultaneously since the server started. Connections is the number of connection attempts (successful or not) to the MySQL server. MySQL Client Thread Activity \u00b6 MySQL Active Threads Threads Connected is the number of open connections, while Threads Running is the number of threads not sleeping. MySQL Handlers \u00b6 MySQL Handlers Handler statistics are internal statistics on how MySQL is selecting, updating, inserting, and modifying rows, tables, and indexes. This is in fact the layer between the Storage Engine and MySQL. read_rnd_next is incremented when the server performs a full table scan and this is a counter you don\u2019t really want to see with a high value. read_key is incremented when a read is done with an index. read_next is incremented when the storage engine is asked to \u2018read the next index entry\u2019. A high value means a lot of index scans are being done. Top Command Counters \u00b6 Top Command Counters The Com_ statement counter variables indicate the number of times each xxx statement has been executed. There is one status variable for each type of statement. For example, Com_delete and Com_update count DELETE and UPDATE statements, respectively. Com_delete_multi and Com_update_multi are similar but apply to DELETE and UPDATE statements that use multiple-table syntax. MySQL Network Traffic \u00b6 MySQL Network Traffic Here we can see how much network traffic is generated by MySQL. Outbound is network traffic sent from MySQL and Inbound is network traffic MySQL has received. Node Summary \u00b6 System Uptime \u00b6 The parameter shows how long a system has been up and running without a shut down or restart. Load Average \u00b6 The system load is a measurement of the computational work the system is performing. Each running process either using or waiting for CPU resources adds 1 to the load. RAM \u00b6 RAM (Random Access Memory) is the hardware in a computing device where the operating system, application programs and data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device\u2019s processor. Memory Available \u00b6 Percent of Memory Available on Modern Linux Kernels amount of Memory Available for application is not the same as Free+Cached+Buffers. Virtual Memory \u00b6 RAM + SWAP Disk Space \u00b6 Sum of disk space on all partitions. It can be significantly over-reported in some installations. Min Space Available \u00b6 Lowest percent of the disk space available. CPU Usage \u00b6 The CPU time is measured in clock ticks or seconds. It is useful to measure CPU time as a percentage of the CPU\u2019s capacity, which is called the CPU usage. CPU Saturation and Max Core Usage \u00b6 When a system is running with maximum CPU utilization, the transmitting and receiving threads must all share the available CPU. This will cause data to be queued more frequently to cope with the lack of CPU. CPU Saturation may be measured as the length of a wait queue, or the time spent waiting on the queue. Disk I/O and Swap Activity \u00b6 Disk I/O includes read or write or input/output operations involving a physical disk. It is the speed with which the data transfer takes place between the hard disk drive and RAM. Swap Activity is memory management that involves swapping sections of memory to and from physical storage. Network Traffic \u00b6 Network traffic refers to the amount of data moving across a network at a given point in time.","title":"MySQL InnoDB Details"},{"location":"details/dashboards/dashboard-mysql-innodb-details.html#mysql-innodb-details","text":"","title":"MySQL InnoDB Details"},{"location":"details/dashboards/dashboard-mysql-innodb-details.html#innodb-activity","text":"","title":"InnoDB Activity"},{"location":"details/dashboards/dashboard-mysql-innodb-details.html#writes-rows","text":"","title":"Writes (Rows)"},{"location":"details/dashboards/dashboard-mysql-innodb-details.html#writes-transactions","text":"","title":"Writes (Transactions)"},{"location":"details/dashboards/dashboard-mysql-innodb-details.html#row-writes-per-trx","text":"Rows Written Per Transactions which modify rows.

If the required number of descriptors are not available, the server reduces the value of Max Connections. mysqld actually permits Max Connections + 1 clients to connect.

Max Used Connections is the maximum number of connections that have been in use simultaneously since the server started. Connections is the number of connection attempts (successful or not) to the MySQL server. MySQL Aborted Connections \u00b6 Aborted Connections When a given host connects to MySQL and the connection is interrupted in the middle (for example due to bad credentials), MySQL keeps that info in a system table (since 5.6 this table is exposed in performance_schema ). If the amount of failed requests without a successful connection reaches the value of max_connect_errors , mysqld assumes that something is wrong and blocks the host from further connection. To allow connections from that host again, you need to issue the FLUSH HOSTS statement. MySQL Client Thread Activity \u00b6 MySQL Active Threads Threads Connected is the number of open connections, while Threads Running is the number of threads not sleeping. MySQL Thread Cache \u00b6 MySQL Thread Cache The thread_cache_size variable sets how many threads the server should cache to reuse. When a client disconnects, the client\u2019s threads are put in the cache if the cache is not full. It is auto-sized in MySQL 5.6.8 and above (capped to 100). Requests for threads are satisfied by reusing threads taken from the cache if possible, and only when the cache is empty is a new thread created. threads_created : The number of threads created to handle connections. threads_cached : The number of threads in the thread cache. MySQL Slow Queries \u00b6 MySQL Slow Queries Slow queries are defined as queries being slower than the long_query_time setting. For example, if you have long_query_time set to 3, all queries that take longer than 3 seconds to complete will show on this graph. MySQL Select Types \u00b6 MySQL Select Types As with most relational databases, selecting based on indexes is more efficient than scanning an entire table\u2019s data. Here we see the counters for selects not done with indexes. Select Scan is how many queries caused full table scans, in which all the data in the table had to be read and either discarded or returned. Select Range is how many queries used a range scan, which means MySQL scanned all rows in a given range. Select Full Join is the number of joins that are not joined on an index, this is usually a huge performance hit. MySQL Sorts \u00b6 MySQL Sorts Due to a query\u2019s structure, order, or other requirements, MySQL sorts the rows before returning them. For example, if a table is ordered 1 to 10 but you want the results reversed, MySQL then has to sort the rows to return 10 to 1. This graph also shows when sorts had to scan a whole table or a given range of a table to return the results and which could not have been sorted via an index. MySQL Table Locks \u00b6 Table Locks MySQL takes a number of different locks for varying reasons. In this graph we see how many Table level locks MySQL has requested from the storage engine. In the case of InnoDB, many times the locks could actually be row locks as it only takes table level locks in a few specific cases. It is most useful to compare Locks Immediate and Locks Waited. If Locks waited is rising, it means you have lock contention. Otherwise, Locks Immediate rising and falling is normal activity. MySQL Questions \u00b6 MySQL Questions The number of statements executed by the server. This includes only statements sent to the server by clients and not statements executed within stored programs, unlike the Queries used in the QPS calculation. This variable does not count the following commands: COM_PING COM_STATISTICS COM_STMT_PREPARE COM_STMT_CLOSE COM_STMT_RESET MySQL Network Traffic \u00b6 MySQL Network Traffic Here we can see how much network traffic is generated by MySQL. Outbound is network traffic sent from MySQL and Inbound is network traffic MySQL has received. MySQL Network Usage Hourly \u00b6 MySQL Network Usage Hourly Here we can see how much network traffic is generated by MySQL per hour. You can use the bar graph to compare data sent by MySQL and data received by MySQL. MySQL Internal Memory Overview \u00b6 System Memory : Total Memory for the system. InnoDB Buffer Pool Data : InnoDB maintains a storage area called the buffer pool for caching data and indexes in memory. TokuDB Cache Size : Similar in function to the InnoDB Buffer Pool, TokuDB will allocate 50% of the installed RAM for its own cache. Key Buffer Size : Index blocks for MyISAM tables are buffered and are shared by all threads. key_buffer_size is the size of the buffer used for index blocks. Adaptive Hash Index Size : When InnoDB notices that some index values are being accessed very frequently, it builds a hash index for them in memory on top of B-Tree indexes. Query Cache Size : The query cache stores the text of a SELECT statement together with the corresponding result that was sent to the client. The query cache has huge scalability problems in that only one thread can do an operation in the query cache at the same time. InnoDB Dictionary Size : The data dictionary is InnoDB\u2019s internal catalog of tables. InnoDB stores the data dictionary on disk, and loads entries into memory while the server is running. InnoDB Log Buffer Size : The MySQL InnoDB log buffer allows transactions to run without having to write the log to disk before the transactions commit. Top Command Counters \u00b6 Top Command Counters The Com_xxx statement counter variables indicate the number of times each xxx statement has been executed. There is one status variable for each type of statement. For example, Com_delete and Com_update count DELETE and UPDATE statements, respectively. Com_delete_multi and Com_update_multi are similar but apply to DELETE and UPDATE statements that use multiple-table syntax. Top Command Counters Hourly \u00b6 Top Command Counters Hourly The Com_xxx statement counter variables indicate the number of times each xxx statement has been executed. There is one status variable for each type of statement. For example, Com_delete and Com_update count DELETE and UPDATE statements, respectively. Com_delete_multi and Com_update_multi are similar but apply to DELETE and UPDATE statements that use multiple-table syntax. MySQL Handlers \u00b6 MySQL Handlers Handler statistics are internal statistics on how MySQL is selecting, updating, inserting, and modifying rows, tables, and indexes. This is in fact the layer between the Storage Engine and MySQL. read_rnd_next is incremented when the server performs a full table scan and this is a counter you don\u2019t really want to see with a high value. read_key is incremented when a read is done with an index. read_next is incremented when the storage engine is asked to \u2018read the next index entry\u2019. A high value means a lot of index scans are being done. MySQL Query Cache Memory \u00b6 MySQL Query Cache Memory The query cache has huge scalability problems in that only one thread can do an operation in the query cache at the same time. This serialization is true not only for SELECTs, but also for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. This also means that the larger the query_cache_size is set to, the slower those operations become. In concurrent environments, the MySQL Query Cache quickly becomes a contention point, decreasing performance. MariaDB and AWS Aurora have done work to try and eliminate the query cache contention in their flavors of MySQL, while MySQL 8.0 has eliminated the query cache feature. The recommended settings for most environments is to set: query_cache_type=0 query_cache_size=0 While you can dynamically change these values, to completely remove the contention point you have to restart the database. MySQL Query Cache Activity \u00b6 MySQL Query Cache Activity The query cache has huge scalability problems in that only one thread can do an operation in the query cache at the same time. This serialization is true not only for SELECTs, but also for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. This also means that the larger the query_cache_size is set to, the slower those operations become.

MySQL Table Open Cache Status \u00b6 MySQL Table Open Cache Status The recommendation is to set the table_open_cache_instances to a loose correlation to virtual CPUs, keeping in mind that more instances means the cache is split more times. If you have a cache set to 500 but it has 10 instances, each cache will only have 50 cached. The table_definition_cache and table_open_cache can be left as default as they are auto-sized MySQL 5.6 and above (i.e., do not set them to any value). MySQL Open Tables \u00b6 MySQL Open Tables The recommendation is to set the table_open_cache_instances to a loose correlation to virtual CPUs, keeping in mind that more instances means the cache is split more times.

Key Buffer Size : Index blocks for MyISAM tables are buffered and are shared by all threads. key_buffer_size is the size of the buffer used for index blocks. Adaptive Hash Index Size : When InnoDB notices that some index values are being accessed very frequently, it builds a hash index for them in memory on top of B-Tree indexes. Query Cache Size : The query cache stores the text of a SELECT statement together with the corresponding result that was sent to the client. The query cache has huge scalability problems in that only one thread can do an operation in the query cache at the same time.

It only applies to a secondary host. SQL Thread is a process that runs on a secondary host in the replication environment. It reads the events from the local relay log file and applies them to the secondary server. Depending on the format of the binary log it can read query statements in plain text and re-execute them or it can read raw data and apply them to the local host. Possible values Yes The thread is running and is connected to a replication primary No The thread is not running because it is not launched yet or because an error has occurred connecting to the primary host Connecting The thread is running but is not connected to a replication primary No value The host is not configured to be a replication secondary IO Thread Running is one of the parameters that the command SHOW SLAVE STATUS returns. SQL Thread Running \u00b6 This metric shows if the SQL thread is running or not. It only applies to a secondary host. Possible values Yes SQL Thread is running and is applying events from the relay log to the local secondary host No SQL Thread is not running because it is not launched yet or because of an error occurred while applying an event to the local secondary host Replication Error No \u00b6 This metric shows the number of the last error in the SQL Thread encountered which caused replication to stop. One of the more common errors is Error: 1022 Duplicate Key Entry . In such a case replication is attempting to update a row that already exists on the secondary. The SQL Thread will stop replication to avoid data corruption. Read only \u00b6 This metric indicates whether the host is configured to be in Read Only mode or not. Possible values Yes The secondary host permits no client updates except from users who have the SUPER privilege or the REPLICATION SLAVE privilege. This kind of configuration is typically used for secondary hosts in a replication environment to avoid a user can inadvertently or voluntarily modify data causing inconsistencies and stopping the replication process. No The secondary host is not configured in Read Only mode. MySQL Replication Delay \u00b6 This metric shows the number of seconds the secondary host is delayed in replication applying events compared to when the primary host applied them, denoted by the Seconds_Behind_Master value, and only applies to a secondary host. Since the replication process applies the data modifications on the secondary asynchronously, it could happen that the secondary replicates events after some time. The main reasons are: Network round trip time - high latency links will lead to non-zero replication lag values. Single threaded nature of replication channels - primary servers have the advantage of applying changes in parallel, whereas secondary ones are only able to apply changes in serial, thus limiting their throughput. In some cases Group Commit can help but is not always applicable. High number of changed rows or computationally expensive SQL - depending on the replication format ( ROW vs STATEMENT ), significant changes to the database through high volume of rows modified, or expensive CPU will all contribute to secondary servers lagging behind the primary. Generally adding more CPU or Disk resources can alleviate replication lag issues, up to a point. Binlog Size \u00b6 This metric shows the overall size of the binary log files, which can exist on both primary and secondary servers. The binary log (also known as the binlog ) contains events that describe database changes: CREATE TABLE , ALTER TABLE , updates, inserts, deletes and other statements or database changes. The binlog file is read by secondaries via their IO Thread process to replicate database changes modification on the data and on the table structures. There can be more than one binlog file depending on the binlog rotation policy (for example using the configuration variables max_binlog_size and expire_logs_days ) or because of server reboots. When planning the disk space, take care of the overall dimension of binlog files and adopt a good rotation policy or think about having a separate mount point or disk to store the binlog data. Binlog Data Written Hourly \u00b6 This metric shows the amount of data written hourly to the binlog files during the last 24 hours. This metric can give you an idea of how big is your application in terms of data writes (creation, modification, deletion). Binlog Count \u00b6 This metric shows the overall count of binary log files, on both primary and secondary servers. Binlogs Created Hourly \u00b6 This metric shows the number of binlog files created hourly during the last 24 hours. Relay Log Space \u00b6 This metric shows the overall size of the relay log files. It only applies to a secondary host. The relay log consists of a set of numbered files containing the events to be executed on the secondary host to replicate database changes. The relay log has the same format as the binlog. There can be multiple relay log files depending on the rotation policy adopted (using the configuration variable max_relay_log_size ). As soon as the SQL thread completes to execute all events in the relay log file, the file is deleted. If this metric contains a high value, the variable max_relay_log_file is high too. Generally, this not a serious issue. If the value of this metric is constantly increased, the secondary is delaying too much in applying the events.

CPU Usage \u00b6 The CPU time is measured in clock ticks or seconds. It is useful to measure CPU time as a percentage of the CPU\u2019s capacity, which is called the CPU usage. CPU Saturation and Max Core Usage \u00b6 When a system is running with maximum CPU utilization, the transmitting and receiving threads must all share the available CPU. This will cause data to be queued more frequently to cope with the lack of CPU. CPU Saturation may be measured as the length of a wait queue, or the time spent waiting on the queue. Interrupts and Context Switches \u00b6 Interrupt is an input signal to the processor indicating an event that needs immediate attention. An interrupt signal alerts the processor and serves as a request for the processor to interrupt the currently executing code, so that the event can be processed in a timely manner. Context switch is the process of storing the state of a process or thread, so that it can be restored and resume execution at a later point.

Version \u00b6 The version of the PostgreSQL instance. Shared Buffers \u00b6 Defines the amount of memory the database server uses for shared memory buffers. Default is 128MB . Guidance on tuning is 25% of RAM, but generally doesn\u2019t exceed 40% . Disk-Page Buffers \u00b6 The setting wal_buffers defines how much memory is used for caching the write-ahead log entries. Generally this value is small ( 3% of shared_buffers value), but it may need to be modified for heavily loaded servers. Memory Size for each Sort \u00b6 The parameter work_mem defines the amount of memory assigned for internal sort operations and hash tables before writing to temporary disk files. The default is 4MB . Disk Cache Size \u00b6 PostgreSQL\u2019s effective_cache_size variable tunes how much RAM you expect to be available for disk caching. Generally adding Linux free+cached will give you a good idea. This value is used by the query planner whether plans will fit in memory, and when defined too low, can lead to some plans rejecting certain indexes. Autovacuum \u00b6 Whether autovacuum process is enabled or not. Generally the solution is to vacuum more often, not less. PostgreSQL Connections \u00b6 Max Connections The maximum number of client connections allowed. Change this value with care as there are some memory resources that are allocated on a per-client basis, so setting max_connections higher will generally increase overall PostgreSQL memory usage. Connections The number of connection attempts (successful or not) to the PostgreSQL server. Active Connections The number of open connections to the PostgreSQL server. PostgreSQL Tuples \u00b6 Tuples The total number of rows processed by PostgreSQL server: fetched, returned, inserted, updated, and deleted. Read Tuple Activity The number of rows read from the database: as returned so fetched ones. Tuples Changed per 5 min The number of rows changed in the last 5 minutes: inserted, updated, and deleted ones. PostgreSQL Transactions \u00b6 Transactions The total number of transactions that have been either been committed or rolled back. Duration of Transactions Maximum duration in seconds any active transaction has been running. Temp Files \u00b6 Number of Temp Files The number of temporary files created by queries. Size of Temp files The total amount of data written to temporary files by queries in bytes. All temporary files are taken into account by these two gauges, regardless of why the temporary file was created (e.g., sorting or hashing), and regardless of the log_temp_files setting. Conflicts and Locks \u00b6 Conflicts/Deadlocks The number of queries canceled due to conflicts with recovery in the database (due to dropped tablespaces, lock timeouts, old snapshots, pinned buffers, or deadlocks). Number of Locks The number of deadlocks detected by PostgreSQL. Buffers and Blocks Operations \u00b6 Operations with Blocks The time spent reading and writing data file blocks by back ends, in milliseconds. Capturing read and write time statistics is possible only if track_io_timing setting is enabled. This can be done either in configuration file or with the following query executed on the running system: ALTER SYSTEM SET track_io_timing = ON ; SELECT pg_reload_conf (); Buffers The number of buffers allocated by PostgreSQL. Canceled Queries \u00b6 The number of queries that have been canceled due to dropped tablespaces, lock timeouts, old snapshots, pinned buffers, and deadlocks. Data shown by this gauge are based on the pg_stat_database_conflicts view. Cache Hit Ratio \u00b6 The number of times disk blocks were found already in the buffer cache, so that a read was not necessary. This only includes hits in the PostgreSQL buffer cache, not the operating system\u2019s file system cache. Checkpoint Stats \u00b6 The total amount of time that has been spent in the portion of checkpoint processing where files are either written or synchronized to disk, in milliseconds.

Open the PMM Settings page with one of: the main menu: choose PMM\u2192PMM Settings search dashboards by name: type PMM Settings and click the search result On the left of the page is a set of sub-page selector tabs. (The Communication tab remains hidden until Integrated Alerting is activated.) Click Apply changes after changing settings. Diagnostics \u00b6 Common to all sections is Diagnostics . PMM can generate a set of diagnostics data which can be examined and/or shared with our support team in case of some issue to solve it faster. You can get collected logs from PMM Server by clicking Download server diagnostics . Metrics resolution \u00b6 Metrics are collected at three intervals representing low, medium and high resolutions. Short time intervals are regarded as high resolution metrics, while those at longer time intervals are low resolution. The Metrics Resolution radio button lets you select one of four presets. Rare , Standard and Frequent are fixed presets. Custom is an editable preset. Each preset is a group of Low, Medium and High metrics resolution values. A low resolution interval increases the time between collection, resulting in low-resolution metrics and lower disk usage. A high resolution interval decreases the time between collection, resulting in high-resolution metrics and higher disk usage. The default values (in seconds) for the fixed presets and their resolution names are: Preset Low Medium High Rare 300 180 60 Standard 60 10 5 Frequent 30 5 1 Values for the Custom preset can be entered as values, or changed with the arrows. If there is poor network connectivity between PMM Server and PMM Client, or between PMM Client and the database server it is monitoring, scraping every second may not be possible when the network latency is greater than 1 second. Advanced Settings \u00b6 Data Retention \u00b6 Data retention specifies how long data is stored by PMM Server. By default, PMM stores time-series data for 30 days. Depending on your available disk space and requirements, you may need to adjust the data retention time. Telemetry \u00b6 The Telemetry switch enables gathering and sending basic anonymous data to Percona, which helps us to determine where to focus the development and what is the uptake of the various versions of PMM. Specifically, gathering this information helps determine if we need to release patches to legacy versions beyond support, determining when supporting a particular version is no longer necessary, and even understanding how the frequency of release encourages or deters adoption. Currently, only the following information is gathered: PMM Version, Installation Method (Docker, AMI, OVF), the Server Uptime. We do not gather anything that would make the system identifiable, but the following two things are to be mentioned: The Country Code is evaluated from the submitting IP address before it is discarded. We do create an \u201cinstance ID\u201d - a random string generated using UUID v4. This instance ID is generated to distinguish new instances from existing ones, for figuring out instance upgrades. The first telemetry reporting of a new PMM Server instance is delayed by 24 hours to allow sufficient time to disable the service for those that do not wish to share any information. There is a landing page for this service, available at check.percona.com , which clearly explains what this service is, what it\u2019s collecting, and how you can turn it off. Grafana\u2019s anonymous usage statistics is not managed by PMM. To activate it, you must change the PMM Server container configuration after each update. As well as via the PMM Settings page, you can also disable telemetry with the -e DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1 option in your docker run statement for the PMM Server. If the Security Threat Tool is enabled in PMM Settings, Telemetry is automatically enabled. Telemetry is sent immediately; the 24-hour grace period is not honored. Check for updates \u00b6 When active, PMM will automatically check for updates and put a notification in the Updates dashboard if any are available. Security Threat Tool \u00b6 The Security Threat Tool performs a range of security-related checks on a registered instance and reports the findings. It is disabled by default. It can be enabled in PMM\u2192PMM Settings\u2192Settings\u2192Advanced Settings\u2192Security Threat Tool . The checks are re-fetched and re-run every 24 hours. The results can be viewed in PMM\u2192PMM Database Checks . DBaaS \u00b6 A read-only setting that shows whether DBaaS features are activated on this server. Caution DBaaS functionality is a technical preview that must be turned on with a server feature flag. See Setting up a development environment for DBaaS . Integrated Alerting \u00b6 Enables Integrated Alerting and reveals the Communication tab. Public Address \u00b6 Public address for accessing DBaaS features on this server. SSH Key \u00b6 This section lets you upload your public SSH key to access the PMM Server via SSH (for example, when accessing PMM Server as a virtual appliance ). Enter your public key in the SSH Key field and click Apply SSH Key . Alertmanager integration \u00b6 Alertmanager manages alerts, de-duplicating, grouping, and routing them to the appropriate receiver or display component. This section lets you configure integration of VictoriaMetrics with an external Alertmanager. The Alertmanager URL field should contain the URL of the Alertmanager which would serve your PMM alerts. The Alerting rules field is used to specify alerting rules in the YAML configuration format. Fill both fields and click the Apply Alertmanager settings button to proceed. Percona Platform \u00b6 This panel is where you create, and log into and out of your Percona Platform account. Login \u00b6 If you have a Percona Platform account, enter your credentials and click Login . Click Sign out to log out of your Percona Platform account. Sign up \u00b6 To create a Percona Platform account: Click Sign up Enter a valid email address in the Email field Choose and enter a strong password in the Password field Select the check box acknowledging our terms of service and privacy policy Click Sign up A brief message will confirm the creation of your new account and you may now log in with these credentials.

Specifically, gathering this information helps determine if we need to release patches to legacy versions beyond support, determining when supporting a particular version is no longer necessary, and even understanding how the frequency of release encourages or deters adoption. Currently, only the following information is gathered: PMM Version, Installation Method (Docker, AMI, OVF), the Server Uptime. We do not gather anything that would make the system identifiable, but the following two things are to be mentioned: The Country Code is evaluated from the submitting IP address before it is discarded. We do create an \u201cinstance ID\u201d - a random string generated using UUID v4. This instance ID is generated to distinguish new instances from existing ones, for figuring out instance upgrades. The first telemetry reporting of a new PMM Server instance is delayed by 24 hours to allow sufficient time to disable the service for those that do not wish to share any information. There is a landing page for this service, available at check.percona.com , which clearly explains what this service is, what it\u2019s collecting, and how you can turn it off. Grafana\u2019s anonymous usage statistics is not managed by PMM. To activate it, you must change the PMM Server container configuration after each update.

Updating a Server \u00b6 Client and server components are installed and updated separately. PMM Server can run natively, as a Docker image, a virtual appliance, or an AWS cloud instance. Each has its own installation and update steps. The preferred and simplest way to update PMM Server is with the PMM Upgrade panel on the Home page. The panel shows: the current server version and release date; whether the server is up to date; the last time a check was made for updates. Click the refresh button to manually check for updates. If one is available, click the update button to update to the version indicated. Upgrade from PMM 1 \u00b6 Because of the significant architectural changes between PMM1 and PMM2, there is no direct upgrade path. The approach to making the switch from PMM version 1 to 2 is a gradual transition, outlined in this blog post . In short, it involves first standing up a new PMM2 server on a new host and connecting clients to it. As new data is reported to the PMM2 server, old metrics will age out during the course of the retention period (30 days, by default), at which point you\u2019ll be able to shut down your existing PMM1 server. Any alerts configured through the Grafana UI will have to be recreated due to the target dashboard id\u2019s not matching between PMM1 and PMM2. In this instance we recommend moving to Alertmanager recipes in PMM2 for alerting which, for the time being, requires a separate Alertmanager instance. However, we are working on integrating this natively into PMM2 Server and expect to support your existing Alertmanager rules.","title":"Upgrade"},{"location":"how-to/upgrade.html#upgrade","text":"Upgrade PMM Server before upgrading PMM Clients.","title":"Upgrade"},{"location":"how-to/upgrade.html#updating-a-server","text":"Client and server components are installed and updated separately. PMM Server can run natively, as a Docker image, a virtual appliance, or an AWS cloud instance. Each has its own installation and update steps. The preferred and simplest way to update PMM Server is with the PMM Upgrade panel on the Home page. The panel shows: the current server version and release date; whether the server is up to date; the last time a check was made for updates. Click the refresh button to manually check for updates. If one is available, click the update button to update to the version indicated.","title":"Updating a Server"},{"location":"how-to/upgrade.html#upgrade-from-pmm1","text":"Because of the significant architectural changes between PMM1 and PMM2, there is no direct upgrade path.

Release Highlights \u00b6 Switch to push metrics by default In PMM 2.12.0, Percona replaced its metrics collection engine (formerly Prometheus) with VictoriaMetrics. Historically, PMM used a pull method with Prometheus while VictoriaMetrics can operate in either a pull or push method. When PMM 2.12.0 was released, Percona kept the default method as pull . Now with PMM 2.14.0, Percona is shifting the default to push for all newly-added instances. This blog post describes the two methods and why push benefits users. Also, here is a post by Peter Zaitzev of FAQs relating to the move to VictoriaMetrics and the push model. Documentation on the push method is here . Note : Installing the 2.14.0 or newer PMM server will change the default behavior on 2.12.0 and 2.13.0 clients from \u201cpull\u201d method to \u201cpush\u201d for any newly added services. Existing services will remain in whatever mode they were prior to upgrade. DBaaS Preview phase 1.0 (Technical Preview) In 2.13.0 we introduced Percona\u2019s Database as a Service (DBaaS) which enables non-DBAs (software architects, developers, site reliability engineers, etc.) to perform typical DBA tasks to manage an organization\u2019s database environment via user interfaces and automation orchestration. This release contains several enhancements and fixes, many directly from user feedback. Note : This capability is feature-flagged and turned off by default. Users require a variable to be passed to PMM to expose this functionality. External services presentation on node summary dashboard Improvements to the user experience for adding and viewing external services (any data that can be monitored by a Prometheus exporter such as: non-Percona supported databases like Redis, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, etc. or an organization\u2019s external application) on the Node Summary dashboard of PMM.

Historically, PMM used a pull method with Prometheus while VictoriaMetrics can operate in either a pull or push method. When PMM 2.12.0 was released, Percona kept the default method as pull . Now with PMM 2.14.0, Percona is shifting the default to push for all newly-added instances. This blog post describes the two methods and why push benefits users. Also, here is a post by Peter Zaitzev of FAQs relating to the move to VictoriaMetrics and the push model. Documentation on the push method is here . Note : Installing the 2.14.0 or newer PMM server will change the default behavior on 2.12.0 and 2.13.0 clients from \u201cpull\u201d method to \u201cpush\u201d for any newly added services. Existing services will remain in whatever mode they were prior to upgrade.

Release Highlights \u00b6 PMM 1 vs. 2 Parity Disable collectors during adding node/service to monitoring With this feature users can disable any collector used by PMM to get metrics. When metrics cannot be collected or are no longer needed, disabling the collector(s) prevents PMM from flooding logs and saves infrastructure resources. Our vision for PMM collectors is to provide \u201cstop from collecting\u201d functionality to prevent possible harm to the user environment. This \u201cdisable\u201d feature is an initial step towards the ideal functionality. The full and flexible management for \u201cWhat metrics to collect and in what resolution\u201d is slated for future releases. External services monitoring Since PMM 1.4.0, users had the ability to monitor external services Percona didn\u2019t currently support (e.g., Redis). This blog article from 2018 nicely described external services monitoring at that time. (At that time Percona was not natively supporting a PostgreSQL monitoring service and so this was listed as an external service. Today, PostgreSQL is natively supported by PMM.) Until now, PMM 2.x didn\u2019t support external services monitoring. With this release, any non-natively supported by PMM service will now become supported with external services monitoring. You can see the list of possible exporters to be used in https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/ . Natively-supported services will continue to deliver an expanded set of metrics and insights. Provide summary information for systems (pt-*-summary actions) With the addition of pt-*-summary in PMM 2, users can now view summary information about services and nodes on PMM\u2019s dashboard. This summary information is in the industry common format of pt-*-summary tools output to simplify portability of this data. This format will also be preserved in the snapshot of the dashboard shared with Percona Support to simplify investigations of issues. Note: pt-*-summary includes formats for: pt-mysql-summary pt-mongodb-summary pt-pg-summary pt-summary HAProxy support by PMM Users are able to add HAProxy Services for monitoring in PMM2. The support level of them in PMM will be the same we have for ProxySQL, so they will be presented in Inventory and on Dashboard. This will allow users who use HAProxy in their HA configuration to also have this component monitored by PMM. In future releases PMM will start use HAProxy by default for the DBaaS feature and will also use this functionality to monitor HAProxy. DBaaS Preview improvements (Technical Preview) From now you will be able to see the progress of internal steps the system makes when executing some operations with DBaaS. The Progress Bar will not be time-related and will present only steps. The Progress Bar component will also reflect the K8s/Operator-related errors to the user, so in the case of errors, you will have the error text on the UI, and no need to use K8s tools to see the error. With the same UI, you will be able to see the latest logs from K8s so they will have even more information about why the error happened. Known Limitations: The progress bar will not provide valuable information for the Delete operation (will be in a later version when we\u2019ll change the API with Operators Team), Operation of DB Cluster Modification will have \u201cstrange\u201d behavior and will start changes from non-zero values of steps.

The API key should have the same level of access (Admin or Viewer) as is required for username/password pairs.

New Features \u00b6 PMM-3387 : Prometheus custom configuration is now supported by PMM Server. The feature is targeted at experienced users and is done by adding the base configuration file into the PMM Server container to be parsed and included into the managed Prometheus configuration. PMM-5186 : Including \u2013-pprof option in the pmm-admin summary command adds pprof debug profiles to the diagnostics data archive PMM-5102 : The new \u201cNode Details\u201d dashboard now displays data from the hardware monitoring sensors in hwmon . The new dashboard is based on the hwmon collector data from the node_exporter . Please note that data may be unavailable for some nodes because of the configuration or virtualization parameters.

For Debian- or Red Hat-based distributions, download .deb / .rpm PMM Client packages and install them . For other Linux distributions, download and unpack generic PMM Client Linux binaries .

In this case, the PMM Client is not installed on the host where the database server is deployed. By using the PMM web interface, you connect to the Amazon RDS DB instance. You only need to provide the IAM user access key (or assign an IAM role) and PMM discovers the Amazon RDS DB instances available for monitoring. First of all, ensure that there is the minimal latency between PMM Server and the Amazon RDS instance. Network connectivity can become an issue for VictoriaMetrics to scrape metrics with 1 second resolution. We strongly suggest that you run PMM Server on AWS (Amazon Web Services) in the same availability zone as Amazon RDS instances. It is crucial that enhanced monitoring be enabled for the Amazon RDS DB instances you intend to monitor. Set the Enable Enhanced Monitoring option in the settings of your Amazon RDS DB instance. Creating an IAM user with permission to access Amazon RDS DB instances \u00b6 It is recommended that you use an IAM user account to access Amazon RDS DB instances instead of using your AWS account. This measure improves security as the permissions of an IAM user account can be limited so that this account only grants access to your Amazon RDS DB instances. On the other hand, you use your AWS account to access all AWS services. The procedure for creating IAM user accounts is well described in the Amazon RDS documentation. This section only goes through the essential steps and points out the steps required for using Amazon RDS with Percona Monitoring and Management. The first step is to define a policy which will hold all the necessary permissions. Then, you need to associate this policy with the IAM user or group. In this section, we will create a new user for this purpose. Creating a policy \u00b6 A policy defines how AWS services can be accessed. Once defined it can be associated with an existing user or group. To define a new policy use the IAM page at AWS. Select the Policies option on the navigation panel and click the Create policy button. On the Create policy page, select the JSON tab and replace the existing contents with the following JSON document. { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [{ \"Sid\" : \"Stmt1508404837000\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"rds:DescribeDBInstances\" , \"cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics\" , \"cloudwatch:ListMetrics\" ], \"Resource\" : [ \"*\" ] }, { \"Sid\" : \"Stmt1508410723001\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"logs:DescribeLogStreams\" , \"logs:GetLogEvents\" , \"logs:FilterLogEvents\" ], \"Resource\" : [ \"arn:aws:logs:*:*:log-group:RDSOSMetrics:*\" ]} ] } Click Review policy and set a name to your policy, such as AmazonRDSforPMMPolicy . Then, click the Create policy button. Creating an IAM user \u00b6 Policies are attached to existing IAM users or groups. To create a new IAM user, select Users on the Identity and Access Management page at AWS. Then click Add user and complete the following steps: On the Add user page, set the user name and select the Programmatic access option under Select AWS access type . Set a custom password and then proceed to permissions by clicking the Permissions button. On the Set permissions page, add the new user to one or more groups if necessary. Then, click Review . On the Add user page, click Create user . Creating an access key for an IAM user \u00b6 To discover an Amazon RDS DB instance in PMM, you either need to use the access key and secret access key of an existing IAM user or an IAM role. To create an access key for use with PMM, open the IAM console and click Users on the navigation pane. Then, select your IAM user. To create the access key, open the Security credentials tab and click the Create access key button. The system automatically generates a new access key ID and a secret access key that you can provide on the PMM Add Instance dashboard to have your Amazon RDS DB instances discovered. You may use an IAM role instead of IAM user provided your Amazon RDS DB instances are associated with the same AWS account as PMM. In case, the PMM Server and Amazon RDS DB instance were created by using the same AWS account, you do not need create the access key ID and secret access key manually. PMM retrieves this information automatically and attempts to discover your Amazon RDS DB instances. Attaching a policy to an IAM user \u00b6 The last step before you are ready to create an Amazon RDS DB instance is to attach the policy with the required permissions to the IAM user. First, make sure that the Identity and Access Management page is open and open Users . Then, locate and open the IAM user that you plan to use with Amazon RDS DB instances. Complete the following steps, to apply the policy: On the Permissions tab, click the Add permissions button. On the Add permissions page, click Attach existing policies directly . Using the Filter , locate the policy with the required permissions (such as AmazonRDSforPMMPolicy ). Select a check-box next to the name of the policy and click Review . The selected policy appears on the Permissions summary page. Click Add permissions . The AmazonRDSforPMMPolicy is now added to your IAM user. Setting up the Amazon RDS DB Instance \u00b6 Query Analytics requires Configuring Performance Schema as the query source, because the slow query log is stored on the AWS (Amazon Web Services) side, and QAN agent is not able to read it. Enable the performance_schema option under Parameter Groups in Amazon RDS. Caution Enabling Performance Schema on T2 instances is not recommended because it can easily run the T2 instance out of memory. When adding a monitoring instance for Amazon RDS, specify a unique name to distinguish it from the local MySQL instance. If you do not specify a name, it will use the client\u2019s host name. Create the pmm user with the following privileges on the Amazon RDS instance that you want to monitor: GRANT SELECT , PROCESS , REPLICATION CLIENT ON * . * TO 'pmm' @ '%' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 10 ; GRANT SELECT , UPDATE , DELETE , DROP ON performance_schema . * TO 'pmm' @ '%' ; If you have Amazon RDS with a MySQL version prior to 5.5, REPLICATION CLIENT privilege is not available there and has to be excluded from the above statement. General system metrics are monitored by using the rds_exporter exporter which replaces node_exporter . rds_exporter gives access to Amazon CloudWatch metrics. node_exporter , used in versions of PMM prior to 1.8.0, was not able to monitor general system metrics remotely. Adding an Amazon RDS MySQL, Aurora MySQL or Remote Instance \u00b6 The preferred method of adding an Amazon RDS database instance to PMM is via the PMM \u2192 PMM Add Instance menu option. This method supports Amazon RDS database instances that use Amazon Aurora, MySQL, or MariaDB engines, as well as any remote PostgreSQL, ProxySQL, MySQL and MongoDB instances. The following steps are needed to add an Amazon RDS database instance to PMM: In the PMM web interface, go to PMM > PMM Add Instance . Select AWS RDS MySQL or Aurora MySQL \u2013 Add a remote instance . Enter the access key ID and the secret access key of your IAM user. Click the Discover button for PMM to retrieve the available Amazon RDS instances. For the instance that you would like to monitor, select the Start monitoring button. You will see a new page with the number of fields. The list is divided into the following groups: Main details , RDS database , Labels , and Additional options . Some already known data, such as already entered AWS access key , are filled in automatically, and some fields are optional. The Main details section allows you to specify the DNS hostname of your instance, the service name to use within PMM, the port your service is listening on, and the database user name and password. The Labels section allows you to specify labels for the environment, the AWS region and availability zone to be used, the Replication set and Cluster names and also it allows you to set the list of custom labels in a key:value format. The Additional options section contains specific flags which allow you to tune the RDS monitoring. They can allow you to skip connection check, to use TLS for the database connection, not to validate the TLS certificate and the hostname, as well as to disable basic and/or enhanced metrics collection for the RDS instance to reduce costs. Also this section contains a database-specific flag, which would allow Query Analytics for the selected remote database: when adding some remote MySQL, AWS RDS MySQL or Aurora MySQL instance, you will be able to choose using performance schema for the database monitoring; when adding a PostgreSQL instance, you will be able to activate using pg_stat_statements extension; when adding a MongoDB instance, you will be able to choose using Query Analytics MongoDB profiler. Finally press the Add service button to start monitoring your instance. Adding an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL instance \u00b6 For PostgreSQL, use the same method described above. In the PMM web interface, go to PMM > PMM Add Instance . Select AWS RDS MySQL or Aurora MySQL \u2013 Add a remote instance . At the moment of writing this guide, the Add button doesn\u2019t mention PostgreSQL but the discovery function already supports it. Follow steps 4 to 6 as in the previous section.

Run the pmm-admin add command to use these monitoring services. Supported versions of MongoDB Query Analytics supports MongoDB version 3.2 or higher. Setting Up the Required Permissions \u00b6 For MongoDB monitoring services to work in Query Analytics, you need to set up the mongodb_exporter user. Here is an example for the MongoDB shell that creates and assigns the appropriate roles to the user. db . createRole ({ role : \"explainRole\" , privileges : [{ resource : { db : \"\" , collection : \"\" }, actions : [ \"listIndexes\" , \"listCollections\" , \"dbStats\" , \"dbHash\" , \"collStats\" , \"find\" ] }], roles : [] }) db . getSiblingDB ( \"admin\" ). createUser ({ user : \"mongodb_exporter\" , pwd : \"s3cR#tpa$$worD\" , roles : [ { role : \"explainRole\" , db : \"admin\" }, { role : \"clusterMonitor\" , db : \"admin\" }, { role : \"read\" , db : \"local\" } ] }) Enabling Profiling \u00b6 For MongoDB to work correctly with Query Analytics, you need to enable profiling in your mongod configuration. (Profiling is not enabled by default because it may reduce the performance of your MongoDB server.) Enabling Profiling on Command Line \u00b6 You can enable profiling from command line when you start the mongod server. This command is useful if you start mongod manually. Run this command as root or by using the sudo command mongod --dbpath = DATABASEDIR --profile 2 --slowms 200 --rateLimit 100 Note that you need to specify a path to an existing directory that stores database files with the --dpbath . When the --profile option is set to 2, mongod collects the profiling data for all operations. To decrease the load, you may consider setting this option to 1 so that the profiling data are only collected for slow operations. The --slowms option sets the minimum time for a slow operation. In the given example, any operation which takes longer than 200 milliseconds is a slow operation. The --rateLimit option, which is available if you use PSMDB instead of MongoDB, refers to the number of queries that the MongoDB profiler collects. The lower the rate limit, the less impact on the performance. However, the accuracy of the collected information decreases as well. Enabling Profiling in the Configuration File \u00b6 If you run mongod as a service, you need to use the configuration file which by default is /etc/mongod.conf . In this file, you need to locate the operationProfiling: section and add the following settings: operationProfiling: slowOpThresholdMs: 200 mode: slowOp These settings affect mongod in the same way as the command line options. Note that the configuration file is in the YAML format. In this format the indentation of your lines is important as it defines levels of nesting. Restart the mongod service to enable the settings. Run this command as root or by using the sudo command service mongod restart Adding MongoDB Service Monitoring \u00b6 Add monitoring as follows: pmm-admin add mongodb --username = pmm --password = pmm where username and password are credentials for the monitored MongoDB access, which will be used locally on the database host. Additionally, two positional arguments can be appended to the command line flags: a service name to be used by PMM, and a service address. If not specified, they are substituted automatically as <node>-mongodb and 127.0.0.1:27017 . The command line and the output of this command may look as follows: pmm-admin add mongodb --username = pmm --password = pmm mongo 127 .0.0.1:27017 MongoDB Service added. Service ID : /service_id/f1af8a88-5a95-4bf1-a646-0101f8a20791 Service name: mongo Beside positional arguments shown above you can specify service name and service address with the following flags: --service-name , --host (the hostname or IP address of the service), and --port (the port number of the service). If both flag and positional argument are present, flag gains higher priority. Here is the previous example modified to use these flags: pmm-admin add mongodb --username = pmm --password = pmm --service-name = mongo --host = 127 .0.0.1 --port = 27017 You can add a MongoDB instance using a UNIX socket with the --socket option: pmm-admin add mongodb --socket = /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock If the password contains special symbols like the \u2018at\u2019 ( @ ) symbol, the host might not be detected correctly. Make sure that you insert the password with special characters replaced with their escape sequences. The simplest way is to use the encodeURIComponent JavaScript function in your browser\u2019s web console (usually found under Development Tools ). Evaluate the function with your password as the parameter. For example: encodeURIComponent ( '$ecRet_pas$w@rd' ) \"%24ecRet_pas%24w%40rd\" Passing SSL parameters to the MongoDB monitoring service \u00b6 SSL/TLS related parameters are passed to an SSL enabled MongoDB server as monitoring service parameters along with the pmm-admin add command when adding the MongoDB monitoring service.

(Amazon RDS is also supported and explained in a separate section .) This page shows you how to set up PMM to monitor a MySQL or MySQL-based database instance. (You should read it completely before starting work.) Here is an overview of the steps involved. Before you start \u00b6 PMM Server is installed and running with a known IP address accessible from the client node. PMM Client is installed and the node registered with PMM Server . You have superuser (root) access on the client host. You have superuser access to any database servers that you want to monitor. Create a database account for PMM \u00b6 It is good practice to use a non-superuser account to connect PMM Client to the monitored database instance. This example creates a database user with name pmm , password pass , and the necessary permissions. CREATE USER 'pmm' @ 'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 10 ; GRANT SELECT , PROCESS , SUPER , REPLICATION CLIENT , RELOAD ON * . * TO 'pmm' @ 'localhost' ; Choose and configure a source \u00b6 Decide which source of metrics to use, and configure your database server for it. The choices are Slow query log and Performance Schema . While you can use both at the same time we recommend using only one\u2013there is some overlap in the data reported, and each incurs a small performance penalty. The choice depends on the version and variant of your MySQL instance, and how much detail you want to see. Here are the benefits and drawbacks of Slow query log and Performance Schema metrics sources. Benefits Drawbacks Slow query log More detail. PMM Client must be on the same host as the database server or have access to the slow query log. Lower resource impact (with query sampling feature in Percona Server for MySQL). Log files grow and must be actively managed. Performance Schema Faster parsing. Less detail. Enabled by default on newer versions of MySQL. Data source recommendations Database server Versions Recommended source MySQL 5.1-5.5 Slow query log MySQL 5.6+ Performance Schema MariaDB 10.0+ Performance Schema Percona Server for MySQL 5.7, 8.0 Slow query log Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.6, 5.7, 8.0 Slow query log Slow query log \u00b6 This section covers how to configure a MySQL-based database server to use the slow query log as a source of metrics. Applicable versions Server Versions MySQL 5.1-5.5 MariaDB 10.1.2+ Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.10+, 8.0.12+ Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.6, 5.7, 8.0 The slow query log records the details of queries that take more than a certain amount of time to complete. With the database server configured to write this information to a file rather than a table, PMM Client parses the file and sends aggregated data to PMM Server via the Query Analytics part of PMM Agent. Settings Variable Value Description slow_query_log ON Enables the slow query log. log_output 'FILE' Ensures the log is sent to a file. (This is the default on MariaDB.) long_query_time 0 The slow query threshold in seconds. In heavily-loaded applications, many quick queries can affect performance more than a few slow ones. Setting this value to 0 ensures all queries are captured. log_slow_admin_statements ON Includes the logging of slow administrative statements. log_slow_slave_statements ON Enables logging for queries that have taken more than long_query_time seconds to execute on the replica. Examples Configuration file slow_query_log = ON log_output = FILE long_query_time = 0 log_slow_admin_statements = ON log_slow_slave_statements = ON Session SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 1 ; SET GLOBAL log_output = 'FILE' ; SET GLOBAL long_query_time = 0 ; SET GLOBAL log_slow_admin_statements = 1 ; SET GLOBAL log_slow_slave_statements = 1 ; Slow query log \u2013 extended \u00b6 Some MySQL-based database servers support extended slow query log variables. Applicable versions Server Versions Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.10+, 8.0.12+ Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.6, 5.7, 8.0 MariaDB 10.0 Settings Variable Value Description log_slow_rate_limit 100 Defines the rate of queries captured by the slow query log . A good rule of thumb is 100 queries logged per second. For example, if your Percona Server instance processes 10,000 queries per second, you should set log_slow_rate_limit to 100 and capture every 100 th query for the slow query log . Depending on the amount of traffic, logging could become aggressive and resource consuming. This variable throttles the level of intensity of the data capture without compromising information. log_slow_rate_type \u2018query\u2019 Set so that it applies to queries, rather than sessions. slow_query_log_always_write_time 1 Specifies which queries should ignore sampling. With query sampling this ensures that queries with longer execution time will always be captured by the slow query log, avoiding the possibility that infrequent slow queries might not get captured at all. log_slow_verbosity \u2018full\u2019 Ensures that all information about each captured query is stored in the slow query log. slow_query_log_use_global_control \u2018all\u2019 Configure the slow query log during runtime and apply these settings to existing connections. (By default, slow query log settings apply only to new sessions.) Examples Configuration file (Percona Server for MySQL, Percona XtraDB Cluster) log_slow_rate_limit = 100 log_slow_rate_type = 'query' slow_query_log_always_write_time = 1 log_slow_verbosity = 'full' slow_query_log_use_global_control = 'all' Configuration file (MariaDB) log_slow_rate_limit = 100 Session (Percona Server for MySQL, Percona XtraDB Cluster) SET GLOBAL log_slow_rate_limit = 100 ; SET GLOBAL log_slow_rate_type = 'query' ; SET GLOBAL slow_query_log_always_write_time = 1 ; SET GLOBAL log_slow_verbosity = 'full' ; SET GLOBAL slow_query_log_use_global_control = 'all' ; Slow query log rotation \u00b6 Slow query log files can grow quickly and must be managed. When adding a service with the command line use the pmm-admin option --size-slow-logs to set at what size the slow query log file is rotated. (The size is specified as a number with a suffix. See pmm-admin add mysql .) When the limit is reached, PMM Client will: remove the previous .old slow log file, rename the current file by adding the suffix .old , execute the MySQL command FLUSH LOGS . Only one .old file is kept. Older ones are deleted. You can manage log rotation yourself, for example, with logrotate . If you do, you can disable PMM Client\u2019s log rotation with the --slow-log-rotation=false option when adding a service with pmm-admin add . Performance Schema \u00b6 This section covers how to configure a MySQL-based database server to use Performance Schema as a source of metrics. Applicable versions Server Versions Percona Server for MySQL 5.6, 5.7, 8.0 Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.6, 5.7, 8.0 MariaDB 10.3+ PMM\u2019s MySQL Performance Schema Details dashboard charts the various performance_schema metrics. To use Performance Schema , set these variables. Variable Value Description performance_schema ON Enables Performance Schema metrics.

Examples Configuration file performance_schema = ON performance-schema-instrument = 'statement/%=ON' performance-schema-consumer-statements-digest = ON innodb_monitor_enable = all Session ( performance_schema cannot be set in a session and must be set at server start-up.) UPDATE performance_schema . setup_consumers SET ENABLED = 'YES' WHERE NAME LIKE '%statements%' ; SET GLOBAL innodb_monitor_enable = all ; MariaDB 10.5.7 or lower There is no Explain or Example data shown by default in Query Analytics when monitoring MariaDB instances version 10.5.7 or lower.

Session UPDATE performance_schema . setup_instruments SET ENABLED = 'YES' , TIMED = 'YES' WHERE NAME LIKE 'statement/%' ; UPDATE performance_schema . setup_consumers SET ENABLED = 'YES' WHERE NAME LIKE '%statements%' ; Query response time \u00b6 Query time distribution is a chart in the Details tab of Query Analytics showing the proportion of query time spent on various activities. It is enabled with the query_response_time_stats variable and associated plugins. Applicable versions Server Versions Percona Server for MySQL 5.7 ( not Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 .) MariaDB 10.0.4 Set this variable to see query time distribution charts. Variable Value Description query_response_time_stats ON Report query response time distributions .

For specific details on supported platforms and versions, see Percona\u2019s Software Platform Lifecycle page . To monitor PostgreSQL queries, you must install a database extension. There are two choices: pg_stat_monitor , a new extension created by Percona, based on pg_stat_statements and compatible with it. pg_stat_statements , the original extension created by PostgreSQL, part of the postgres-contrib package available on Linux. (We recommend using only one. If you use both, you will get duplicate metrics.) pg_stat_monitor provides all the features of pg_stat_statements , but extends it to provide bucket-based data aggregation, a feature missing from pg_stat_statements . ( pg_stat_statements accumulates data without providing aggregated statistics or histogram information.) Important While we recommend use of the newer pg_stat_monitor extension, be aware that it is currently beta status and unsupported. Prerequisites \u00b6 We recommend that you create a PostgreSQL user for SUPERUSER level access. This lets you gather the most data with the least fuss. This user must be able to connect to the postgres database where the extension was installed. The PostgreSQL user should have local password authentication enabled to access PMM. To do this, set ident to md5 for the user in the pg_hba.conf configuration file. To create a superuser: CREATE USER pmm_user WITH SUPERUSER ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '******' ; Or, if your database runs on Amazon RDS: CREATE USER pmm_user WITH rds_superuser ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '******' ; pg_stat_monitor \u00b6 pg_stat_monitor collects statistics and aggregates data in a data collection unit called a bucket linked together to form a bucket chain . You can specify: the number of buckets (the length of the chain); how much space is available for all buckets; a time limit for each bucket\u2019s data collection (the bucket expiry ). When a bucket\u2019s expiration time is reached, accumulated statistics are reset and data is stored in the next available bucket in the chain. When all buckets in the chain have been used, the first bucket is reused and its contents are overwritten. If a bucket fills before its expiration time is reached, data is discarded. Compatibility \u00b6 pg_stat_monitor has been tested with: PostgreSQL versions 11, 12, 13. Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL versions 11, 12, 13. Install \u00b6 This extension can be installed in two ways: For Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL: Using standard Linux package manager tools. For PostgreSQL or Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL: download and compile the source code . Install using Linux package manager \u00b6 The pg-stat-monitor extension is included in Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL . This can be installed via the percona-release package.

Make sure that you give it a name to distinguish from other instances managed via the EC2 console. Running the instance \u00b6 After you add your new instance it will take some time to initialize it. When the AWS console reports that the instance is now in a running state, you many continue with configuration of PMM Server. When started the next time after rebooting, your instance may acquire another IP address. You may choose to set up an elastic IP to avoid this problem. With your instance selected, open its IP address in a web browser. The IP address appears in the IPv4 Public IP column or as value of the Public IP field at the top of the Properties panel. To run the instance, copy and paste its public IP address to the location bar of your browser. In the Percona Monitoring and Management welcome page that opens, enter the instance ID. You can copy the instance ID from the Properties panel of your instance, select the Description tab back in the EC2 console. Click the Copy button next to the Instance ID field.

PMM Server provides user access control, and therefore you will need user credentials to access it: Default user name: admin Default password: admin You will be prompted to change the default password every time you log in. The PMM Server is now ready and the home page opens. You are creating a username and password that will be used for two purposes: authentication as a user to PMM - the credentials to log in to PMM. authentication between PMM Server and PMM Clients - you will re-use these credentials when configuring PMM Client for the first time on a server, for example: pmm-admin config --server-insecure-tls --server-url = https://admin:admin@<IP Address>:443 For instructions about how to access your instances by using an SSH client, see Connecting to Your Linux Instance Using SSH Make sure to replace the user name ec2-user used in this document with admin . Resizing the EBS Volume \u00b6 Your AWS instance comes with a predefined size which can become a limitation. To make more disk space available to your instance, you need to increase the size of the EBS volume as needed and then your instance will reconfigure itself to use the new size. The procedure of resizing EBS volumes is described in the Amazon documentation: Modifying the Size, IOPS, or Type of an EBS Volume on Linux . After the EBS volume is updated, PMM Server instance will auto-detect changes in approximately 5 minutes or less and will reconfigure itself for the updated conditions. Upgrading PMM Server on AWS \u00b6 Upgrading EC2 instance class \u00b6 Upgrading to a larger EC2 instance class is supported by PMM provided you follow the instructions from the AWS manual . The PMM AMI image uses a distinct EBS volume for the PMM data volume which permits independent resizing of the EC2 instance without impacting the EBS volume. Expanding the PMM Data EBS Volume \u00b6 The PMM data volume is mounted as an XFS formatted volume on top of an LVM volume. There are two ways to increase this volume size: Add a new disk via EC2 console or API, and expand the LVM volume to include the new disk volume. Expand existing EBS volume and grow the LVM volume. Expand existing EBS volume \u00b6 To expand the existing EBS volume for increased capacity, follow these steps. Expand the disk from AWS Console/CLI to the desired capacity. Login to the PMM EC2 instance and verify that the disk capacity has increased. For example, if you have expanded disk from 16G to 32G, dmesg output should look like below: [ 535.994494] xvdb: detected capacity change from 17179869184 to 34359738368 You can check information about volume groups and logical volumes with the vgs and lvs commands: vgs VG #PV #LV #SN Attr VSize VFree DataVG 1 2 0 wz--n- <16.00g 0 lvs LV VG Attr LSize Pool Origin Data% Meta% Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert DataLV DataVG Vwi-aotz-- <12.80g ThinPool 1.74 ThinPool DataVG twi-aotz-- 15.96g 1.39 1.29 Now we can use the lsblk command to see that our disk size has been identified by the kernel correctly, but LVM2 is not yet aware of the new size.

Deleting clusters \u00b6 You should delete all installation operators as the operators own resources. If you only run eksctl delete cluster without cleaning up the cluster first, there will be a lot of orphaned resources as Cloud Formations, Load Balancers, EC2 instances, Network interfaces, etc. In the pmm-managed repository, in the deploy directory there are 2 example bash scripts to install and delete the operators from the EKS cluster. The install script: #!/bin/bash TOP_DIR = $( git rev-parse --show-toplevel ) PMM_USER = \" $( echo -n 'admin' | base64 ) \" ; PMM_PASS = \" $( echo -n 'admin_password' | base64 ) \" ; KUBECTL_CMD = \"kubectl --kubeconfig ${ HOME } /.kube/config_eks\" # Install the PXC operator cat ${ TOP_DIR } /deploy/pxc_operator.yaml | ${ KUBECTL_CMD } apply -f - cat ${ TOP_DIR } /deploy/secrets.yaml | sed \"s/pmmserver:.*=/pmmserver: ${ PMM_PASS } /g\" | ${ KUBECTL_CMD } apply -f - # Install the PSMDB operator cat ${ TOP_DIR } /deploy/psmdb_operator.yaml | ${ KUBECTL_CMD } apply -f - cat ${ TOP_DIR } /deploy/secrets.yaml | sed \"s/PMM_SERVER_USER:.* $ /PMM_SERVER_USER: ${ PMM_USER } /g;s/PMM_SERVER_PASSWORD:.*= $ /PMM_SERVER_PASSWORD: ${ PMM_PASS } /g;\" | ${ KUBECTL_CMD } apply -f - The delete script: #!/bin/bash TOP_DIR = $( git rev-parse --show-toplevel ) PMM_USER = \" $( echo -n 'admin' | base64 ) \" ; PMM_PASS = \" $( echo -n 'admin_password' | base64 ) \" ; KUBECTL_CMD = \"kubectl --kubeconfig ${ HOME } /.kube/config_eks\" # Delete the PXC operator cat ${ TOP_DIR } /deploy/pxc_operator.yaml | ${ KUBECTL_CMD } delete -f - cat ${ TOP_DIR } /deploy/secrets.yaml | sed \"s/pmmserver:.*=/pmmserver: ${ PMM_PASS } /g\" | ${ KUBECTL_CMD } delete -f - # Delete the PSMDB operator cat ${ TOP_DIR } /deploy/psmdb_operator.yaml | ${ KUBECTL_CMD } delete -f - cat ${ TOP_DIR } /deploy/secrets.yaml | sed \"s/PMM_SERVER_USER:.* $ /PMM_SERVER_USER: ${ PMM_USER } /g;s/PMM_SERVER_PASSWORD:.*= $ /PMM_SERVER_PASSWORD: ${ PMM_PASS } /g;\" | ${ KUBECTL_CMD } delete -f - (Both scripts are similar except the install script command is apply while in the delete script it is delete .) After deleting everything in the EKS cluster, run this command (using your own configuration path) and wait until the output only shows service/kubernetes before deleting the cluster with the eksclt delete command. kubectl --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config_eks get all Example output: NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE service/kubernetes ClusterIP 10.100.0.1 <none> 443/TCP 4d5h If you don\u2019t need the cluster anymore, you can uninstall everything in it and destroy it: # Delete all volumes created by the operators: kubectl [ --kubeconfig <config file> ] delete pvc --all # Delete the cluster eksctl delete cluster --name = your-cluster-name Run PMM Server as a Docker container for DBaaS \u00b6 Start PMM server from a feature branch: docker run --detach --name pmm-server --publish 80 :80 --publish 443 :443 --env PERCONA_TEST_DBAAS = 1 percona/pmm-server:2 ; Important Use --network minikube if running PMM Server and minikube in the same Docker instance. This way they will share single network and the kubeconfig will work. Use Docker variables --env PMM_DEBUG=1 --env PMM_TRACE=1 to see extended debug details.

In such situations no data is reported and a gap appears in the sparkline. Filters Panel \u00b6 The Filter panel occupies the left side of the dashboard. It lists filters, grouped by category. Selecting one reduces the Overview list to those items matching the filter. The first five of each category are shown.

Pagination The pagination device lets you move forwards or backwards through pages, jump to a specific page, and choose how many items are listed per page. Queries are grouped into pages of 25, 50 or 100 items. Details Panel \u00b6 Selecting an item in the Overview panel opens the Details panel with a Details Tab . If the dimension is Query , the panel also contains the Examples Tab , Explain Tab , and Tables Tab . Details Tab \u00b6 The Details tab contains a Query time distribution bar (only for MySQL databases) and a set of Metrics in collapsible subpanels. The Query time distribution bar shows a query\u2019s total time made up of colored segments, each segment representing the proportion of time spent on one of the follow named activities: query_time : Statement execution time. lock_time : Time to acquire locks. blk_read_time : Total time the statement spent reading blocks (if track_io_timing is enabled, otherwise zero). blk_write_time : Total time the statement spent writing blocks (if track_io_timing is enabled, otherwise zero). innodb_io_r_wait : Time for InnoDB to read the data from storage. innodb_queue_wait : Time the query spent either waiting to enter the InnoDB queue, or in it pending execution. innodb_rec_lock_wait : Time the query waited for row locks. other : Remaining uncategorized query time. Metrics is a table with these headings: Metric : The Metric name, with a question-mark tool-tip that reveals a description of the metric on mouse-over. Rate/Second : A sparkline chart of real-time values per unit time. Sum : A summation of the metric for the selected query, and the percentage of the total. Per Query Stats : The value of the metric per query. Each row in the table is a metric. The contents depends on the chosen dimension. Examples Tab \u00b6 (For Query dimension.) The Examples tab shows an example of the selected query\u2019s fingerprint or table element. Explain Tab \u00b6 (For Query dimension.) The Explain tab shows the explain output for the selected query, in Classic or JSON formats: MySQL: Classic and JSON MongoDB: JSON only PostgreSQL: Not supported Tables Tab \u00b6 (For Query dimension.) The Tables tab shows information on the tables and indexes involved in the selected query. Query Analytics for MongoDB \u00b6 MongoDB is conceptually different from relational database management systems, such as MySQL and MariaDB. Relational database management systems store data in tables that represent single entities. Complex objects are represented by linking tables. In contrast, MongoDB uses the concept of a document where all essential information for a complex object is stored in one place. Query Analytics can monitor MongoDB queries. Although MongoDB is not a relational database management system, you analyze its databases and collections in the same interface using the same tools.","title":"Query Analytics"},{"location":"using/query-analytics.html#query-analytics","text":"The Query Analytics dashboard shows how queries are executed and where they spend their time. It helps you analyze database queries over time, optimize database performance, and find and remedy the source of problems. Query Analytics supports MySQL, MongoDB and PostgreSQL. The minimum requirements for MySQL are: MySQL 5.1 or later (if using the slow query log) MySQL 5.6.9 or later (if using Performance Schema) Query Analytics displays metrics in both visual and numeric form. Performance-related characteristics appear as plotted graphics with summaries.
